Hello! I am Huu Cao, a first-year student studying Master of Business Analytics at Monash University. I have a passion for computing and coding, and I am currently exploring various aspects of data analysis throughout my studies. I am working on projects related to some interesting insights on 2021-22 Premier League Halftime. In my free time, you can find me playing billiards, going shopping or capturing photos of Melbourne's famous landscapes. I look forward to connecting with others who share my interests in coding and analyzing data. Feel free to contact me on GitHub or other social networks!
